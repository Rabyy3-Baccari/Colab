# Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition

This repository contains an implementation of a **Siamese Neural Network** for **One-shot Image Recognition**, reimplemented from scratch. The project is based on the methods presented in the paper on **Siamese Networks** for similarity learning and is applied to facial recognition using the **Faces in the Wild** dataset.

## Overview

One-shot learning is a challenging problem in machine learning, where the goal is to correctly classify new examples based on a single training example. Siamese Neural Networks offer an effective approach to tackling this problem by learning to differentiate between pairs of images, making them highly suitable for tasks like facial recognition where distinguishing between unique instances with minimal data is key.

## Dataset

- **Dataset**: [Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
- **Usage**: The dataset provides labeled face images for training the network to recognize and differentiate between unique individuals based on a one-shot learning approach.

## Model Architecture

The network consists of two identical subnetworks with shared weights, which learn to map input images into a feature space where similar images have closer representations. During training, the model minimizes the distance between representations of the same class (positive pairs) and maximizes the distance for images of different classes (negative pairs).

### Key Components
- **Contrastive Loss**: Used to optimize the network by pushing representations of similar images closer together and dissimilar ones farther apart.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction from input images.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Mapping extracted features to a lower-dimensional representation.
